# 🧠 The Ultimate Overthinking Engine™ 🎯  
Making Mountains Out of Molehills Since 2025

## Basic Details  
### Team Name: Phoebe

### Team Members  
- *Team Lead:* Jyotsna – College of Engineering, Karunagappally
- *Member 2:* Mahima – College of Engineering, Karunagappally


## 📘 Project Description  
A satirical web dashboard that visualizes the chaos of overthinking. It turns mental spirals into interactive analytics, gamifies indecision, and celebrates the art of making simple things complex.

---

## ❓ The Problem (that doesn't exist)  
People are making decisions too quickly. The world needs more hesitation, more spiraling, and more regret possibilities.

---

## 💡 The Solution (that nobody asked for)  
We built a hyper-analytical engine that tracks anxiety levels, thought spirals, and decision avoidance. It rewards indecision and celebrates mental exhaustion with achievements and absurd metrics.
